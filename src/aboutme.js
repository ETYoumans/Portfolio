          I stumbled my way into the programming and software development world. I was studying physics while my roommate was working on his first CS project. I began watching him code, started picking up on it, and ended up helping him solve a problem. I doubt I help a significant amount, but it made me interested.
          I enjoy taking something from an idea to something people will actually use. I like seeing the whole system come together, from the overarching architecture to the fine tuned details.
          I stumbled into programming while studying physics. My roommate was working on his first CS project, and I started watching him code. I started to pick things up, even helping him solve a problem (probably not very well), and that got me hooked.
          What I’ve found since then is that I really enjoy building things people can actually use. There’s something satisfying about seeing all the moving parts of a project come together into a full application.
          I like thinking about the big-picture system architecture, but I’m just as happy diving into the small details to make the tech actually work. My goal is always to keep the code flexible and clean enough that I can swap out any piece without breaking everything.
          Outside of coding, I enjoy gaming, especially mods and randomizers. I’m always open to collaboration and new opportunities. If something here caught your eye, I’d love to talk.
